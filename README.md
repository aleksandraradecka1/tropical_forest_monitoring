#### Goal: 
to compare deforestation rates of the REDD+ research sites and their vicinities over the period of 2009-2022

#### Data:
- 'Annual change' products belonging to JRC Tropical Moist Forests initiative [1], disributed in a TIFF format
- research sites' boundaries supplied with the information on the year of monitoring start, in a Shapefile format

#### Research area & time: 
8 research sites located in the Tropical Forest, in northwestern part of Brazil 

#### Processing steps:
1. Initial preparation
2. Calculating the deforestation rate
3. Visualizing example research area's deforestation characteristics
